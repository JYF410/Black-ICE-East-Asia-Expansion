 POLITICS_LORD_LINLITHGOW_DESC:0 "Victor Alexander John Hope, the 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow, served as the Viceroy of India from 1936. His tenure was defined by a staunchly colonialist and autocratic administrative style.\nUpon the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he unilaterally declared war on Germany on behalf of India without consulting leading Indian political parties. This bypass of local consent, followed by the 1942 arrest of hundreds of Indian National Congress leaders—including Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru—under the authority of the British War Cabinet, sparked nationwide protests and civil disobedience. He retired from his post in 1943, leaving behind a deeply fractured subcontinent."
 
 POLITICS_MOHAMMAD_REZA_PAHLAVI_DESC:0 "Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was the last Shah of Iran and the eldest son of Reza Shah.\nDuring WWII, the Allied invasion of Iran forced his father’s abdication due to suspected pro-German sympathies, placing the young Pahlavi on the throne. His early reign saw the rise of Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, who nationalized the oil industry, though a 1953 coup supported by the US and UK reinstated the Shah's absolute authority. Pahlavi is most remembered for his 'White Revolution'—a series of ambitious economic, social, and political reforms aimed at modernizing Iran through industrial nationalization and granting women the right to vote, with the ultimate goal of transforming Iran into a global power."

 

 POLITICS_PHRAYA_PHAHON_DESC:0 "Phraya Phahon Phonphayuhasena was a Thai military leader and the nation's second Prime Minister.\nBorn in Bangkok to a Teochew-Thai family, he studied at the Prussian Military Academy (where he was a classmate of Hermann Göring) and later in Denmark. Returning to Siam in 1912, he rose through the ranks to become Inspector General of the Army. In 1932, he was a key leader of the People's Party that overthrew the absolute monarchy.

 POLITICS_PLAEK_PHIBUNSONGKHRAM_DESC:0 "Plaek Phibunsongkhram, born into a Teochew-Thai family in Nonthaburi, was one of the most influential and controversial figures in Thai history.\nUnlike many of his peers who entered commerce, Plaek pursued a military career, eventually studying at the Fontainebleau Military School in France. There, he was influenced by European nationalism and met future revolutionaries like Pridi Banomyong. After participating in the 1932 Revolution and suppressing subsequent royalist revolts, his prestige soared. In 1938, he became Prime Minister and established a dictatorial regime. He rebranded 'Siam' as 'Thailand,' extended his 'tutelage' over the state, and promoted a brand of hyper-nationalism centered on the slogan 'Thailand for the Thais,' marking a sharp turn toward ethnic chauvinism."

 

 POLITICS_NGUYEN_DESC:0 "Nguyen Tuong Tam, better known by his pen name Nhat Linh, was a celebrated Vietnamese novelist and a prominent member of the VNQDĐ (Vietnamese Nationalist Party).\nIn 1932, he founded the 'Self-Reliance Literary Group' (Tu Luc Van Doan), utilizing the Phong Hoa newspaper to advocate for the modernization of Vietnamese literature and the rejection of stagnant feudal traditions. His political life was as turbulent as his literary one; in 1963, following the South Vietnamese government's brutal suppression of Buddhist protests in Hue, Nhat Linh committed suicide in protest before he could be tried by the regime. His death fueled public outrage against President Ngo Dinh Diem, eventually contributing to the US-backed military coup led by Nguyen Van Thieu."

By 1932, he officially proclaimed the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. To consolidate his rule and unite disparate tribes, he entered into over 300 political marriages, leaving behind dozens of sons to secure the succession.

Working closely with the NKVD, he oversaw a 'Red Terror' within Tuva. In 1944, under his leadership, the Tuvan Little Khural formally petitioned for annexation into the USSR. The request was granted, and the Tuvan People's Republic was absorbed as an autonomous oblast of the Russian SFSR, effectively ending Tuvan independence."

Following the 1931 Mukden Incident and the loss of Manchuria, he was heavily criticized for following Chiang Kai-shek's non-resistance policy. Seeking to end the civil war to fight Japan, he and Yang Hucheng orchestrated the 1936 'Xi'an Incident,' forcing Chiang into a Second United Front with the Communists. For this act, he was placed under house arrest for over 50 years, only gaining freedom long after Chiang's death."

He introduced a new constitution in 1964, expanded women's rights to education, and encouraged Western cultural integration.

 POLITICS_JUDDHA_RANA_DESC:0 "Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana was the Prime Minister of Nepal and a dominant figure of the powerful Rana dynasty.\nRising through the military to become the 'Maharaja' and Prime Minister, he held absolute power over domestic and foreign affairs, reducing the Shah monarchs to mere figureheads. A staunch anglophile, he provided significant military support to the British during the 1857 Indian Mutiny and subsequent World Wars, ensuring Nepal's independence through strategic loyalty. While he modernized the military and legal code, his century-long dynastic rule is also remembered as an era of isolationism and economic stagnation for the common people of Nepal."
 
 POLITICS_TRIBHUWAN_BIr_BIKRAM_SHA_DESC:0 "Tribhuvan Bir Bikram Shah was the 9th King of the Shah Dynasty of Nepal.\nThroughout much of his reign, Tribhuvan was a prisoner in his own palace, as the Rana family held the hereditary post of Prime Minister and absolute executive authority. The tension between the King and the Ranas reached a boiling point during the World Wars. Tribhuvan eventually became a secret patron of the anti-Rana movement, specifically the Nepali Congress party. His efforts to reclaim the monarchy's power and transition Nepal toward a constitutional democracy would eventually lead to the successful 1951 revolution that ended Rana rule."
