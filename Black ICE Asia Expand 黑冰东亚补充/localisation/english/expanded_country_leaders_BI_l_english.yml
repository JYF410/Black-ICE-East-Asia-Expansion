 POLITICS_Mohammed_Ali_Jinnah_DESC:0 "Muhammad Ali Jinnah was the leader of the Pakistan Movement and the founder of the state of Pakistan.\nAs World War II broke out, the United Kingdom, facing the mounting pressure of Nazi Germany, urgently sought support from colonial India. While the Indian National Congress (INC) made a strategic blunder by attempting to blackmail Britain for independence through non-cooperation, Jinnah saw an opportunity for the Muslim League. He expressed a willingness for limited cooperation, helping to maintain provincial order and stability while Gandhi’s followers incited riots that caused massive economic damage. Recognizing his loyalty and leadership, the British concluded that the Muslim League required greater political weight and survival space post-war, laying the essential foundation for the eventual partition and the birth of Pakistan."
 
 POLITICS_Norodom_Sihanouk_DESC:0 "Norodom Sihanouk, known as the 'Father of the Nation,' was the King, Prime Minister, and lifelong Head of State of Cambodia.\nFollowing the death of his grandfather, King Monivong, in 1941, the 19-year-old Sihanouk was selected by the French colonial authorities to ascend the throne. During the Japanese 'Operation Bright Moon' in 1945, which dismantled French Indochina, Sihanouk declared Cambodian independence on April 13. Though he initially sought to align his declaration with Vietnam's, internal communication delays pushed the date back. In 1955, he abdicated in favor of his father to pursue active politics as Prime Minister, later reclaiming the title of Head of State in 1960. His career was defined by a delicate balancing act of neutrality and 'Royal Socialist' policies."
 
 POLITICS_Norodom_Suramarit_DESC:0 "Norodom Suramarit was the King of Cambodia from 1955 to 1960 and the father of Norodom Sihanouk.\nIn his youth, Suramarit was known as a renowned socialite and musician, mastering the saxophone and accordion. Uniquely, his throne was not inherited from his father but granted by his son. In 1941, he had used the threat of suicide to force a reluctant Sihanouk to accept the crown; years later, in 1955, Sihanouk abdicated so he could lead the nation politically, returning the crown to his father. Suramarit's reign was characterized by a deep concern for the common people, who loved him for his generosity. Despite his late-life indulgence in palace pleasures, he remained a staunch defender of the monarchy against its critics."
 
 POLITICS_Pol_Pot_DESC:0 "Pol Pot was the supreme leader of the Khmer Rouge and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Kampuchea.\nEducated in France, he returned to Cambodia in 1953 to join the anti-French jungle insurgency. Pol Pot is infamous for his radical 'Agrarian Socialism' and forced de-urbanization. He believed that cities were parasitic entities that bred inequality and foreign influence. Under his regime, the state was dismantled: schools, hospitals, and currency were abolished. His reign of terror targeted intellectuals—even those merely wearing glasses—and resulted in the deaths of approximately 2 million people through execution, starvation, and forced labor, turning Cambodia into a 'Killing Field.'"

His rule was characterized by extreme brutality; he was often described as a 'steppe brigand' who intercepted trains and plundered cargo.

 POLITICS_PER_ruhollah_musavi_khomeini_DESC:0 "Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, known as Ayatollah Khomeini, was the supreme religious and political leader of the 1979 Iranian Revolution.\nKhomeini spent over 15 years in exile for his fierce opposition to Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. During this time, he developed the theory of 'Velayat-e Faqih' (Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist), which argued that the clergy should hold ultimate political authority. Upon his return, he became the Supreme Leader, a position established in the new constitution as the highest authority in Iran. His leadership was marked by the Iran Hostage Crisis and the devastating Iran-Iraq War. While a hero to many for championing Islamic revival, he remains a deeply controversial figure due to his views on human rights and the execution of political dissidents."
